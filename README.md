## \# BEGINNER PYTHON PROJECTS





###### Hi, I'm Tejas and this is my first repository which will contain small and basic Python Projects. Each Project is in its own folder and includes a short explanation.







## \# PROJECTS





1. ###### Even or Odd Checker = A basic program that checks whether a number is even or odd. 

2. ###### Multiplication Table of a Number= This is a basic program that can be used to print the multiplication table of a number, using both 'for' , and 'while' loop.

3. ###### Factorial of a number= This is a basic Python program to find the factorial of a given number using both a for loop and a while loop.

4. ###### Sum of N natural numbers= This is a basic Python program to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using both a 'for' loop and a 'while loop'

5. ###### Palindrome Checker= This is a basic Python program that checks whether different types of inputs are palindromes.

6. ###### Vowel Counter= This is a basic Python program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a word entered by the user.

7. ###### Vector Arithmetic Overloading= This is a Python program that demonstrates operator overloading using a custom `Vector` class. It performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two-dimensional vectors.

8. ###### Vector Comparison Overloading= This is a Python program that compares two vectors based on their magnitudes using operator overloading.
