## \# Vector Comparison Overloading





###### This is a Python program that compares two vectors based on their magnitudes using operator overloading.







## \## ðŸ“Œ How it works:



###### 1\. A `Vector` class is defined with two components: `a` and `b`  



###### 2\. A method `mag()` calculates the magnitude of the vector  



###### 3\. Comparison operators are overloaded:

###### &nbsp;  - `>` to compare if one vector is greater than another  

###### &nbsp;  - `<` to compare if one vector is smaller  

###### &nbsp;  - `>=` and `<=` for greater or equal / less or equal  

###### &nbsp;  - `==` to check if magnitudes are equal  



###### 4\. Two vector objects are created and compared using all the overloaded operators  



###### 5\. Results of the comparisons are printed
