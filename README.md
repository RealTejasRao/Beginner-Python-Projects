## \# BEGINNER PYTHON PROJECTS





###### Hi, I'm Tejas and this is my first repository which will contain small and basic Python Projects. Each Project is in its own folder and includes a short explanation.







## \# PROJECTS





1. ###### Even or Odd Checker = A basic program that checks whether a number is even or odd. 

2. ###### Multiplication Table of a Number= This is a basic program that can be used to print the multiplication table of a number, using both 'for' , and 'while' loop.

3. ###### Factorial of a number= This is a basic Python program to find the factorial of a given number using both a for loop and a while loop.

4. ###### Sum of N natural numbers= This is a basic Python program to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using both a 'for' loop and a 'while loop'

5. ###### Palindrome Checker= This is a basic Python program that checks whether different types of inputs are palindromes.

6. ###### Vowel Counter= This is a basic Python program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a word entered by the user.

7. ###### Vector Arithmetic Overloading= This is a Python program that demonstrates operator overloading using a custom `Vector` class. It performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two-dimensional vectors.

8. ###### Vector Comparison Overloading= This is a Python program that compares two vectors based on their magnitudes using operator overloading.

9. ###### Number Guessing Game= This is a simple Python number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

10. ###### Simple Calculator= This is a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. It supports both two-number operations and single-number operations like square root.

11. ###### Basic quiz Game= This is a Python quiz game that asks five multiple-choice questions related to Python programming.

12. ###### ROck Paper Scissors= This is a simple Python game where the user plays \*\*Rock, Paper, Scissors\*\* against the computer.

13. ###### Random Password Generator= This is a basic Python script that generates a random password using letters, digits, and special characters. It uses Python's built-in `random` and `string` modules to generate secure, unpredictable passwords.

14. ###### Simple CLock= This is a multi-functional Python script that lets users perform time-based tasks like viewing the current time, using a stopwatch, setting a countdown timer, or scheduling an alarm. It uses modules like `time`, `keyboard`, `colorama`, `playsound`, and `threading` for a responsive and colorful experience.

15. ###### To-Do List= A simple terminal-based To-Do List  that lets users add, view, delete, and complete tasks with colored status indicators.

16. ###### Simple Bank Account SYstem= This is an interactive Python script that simulates a basic banking system with user signup, login authentication, and transaction features. It uses OOP (`class Account`) and libraries like `colorama`, `playsound`, and `threading` for sound effects and enhanced user interaction.

17. ###### Student Management System= A beginner-friendly Python project that allows you to manage student records using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This program runs in the terminal and provides an interactive menu for various student management tasks.
