## \# Quiz Game 1 (Inefficient Version)





###### This is a Python quiz game that asks five multiple-choice questions related to Python programming.

###### This version uses repetitive blocks of code without functions, making it less efficient and harder to maintain.

## \## ðŸ“Œ How it works:



###### 1\. Each question is written separately with its own `while True` loop



###### 2\. After every question, the answer is checked, and feedback is given



###### 3\. A `grade()` function returns a message based on the final score



###### 4\. At the end, the score and message are printed



###### 5\. The game asks the user if they want to play again and repeats or exits
