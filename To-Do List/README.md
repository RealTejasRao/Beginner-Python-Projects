## \#To-Do List Application


###### A simple terminal-based To-Do List  that lets users add, view, delete, and complete tasks with colored status indicators.

###### 

## ðŸ“Œ# How it works:



###### \- The user selects an action from: Add, View, Delete, Complete, or Exit.



###### \- Tasks are stored in a dictionary with their completion status.



###### \- Deletion and completion use the serial number from the displayed task list, not the task name.



###### \- Tasks marked as "Incomplete" appear in bright red, while completed tasks show in bright green.
