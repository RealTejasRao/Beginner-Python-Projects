## \# Simple Bank Account System



###### This is an interactive Python script that simulates a basic banking system with user signup, login authentication, and transaction features.  

###### It uses OOP (`class Account`) and libraries like `colorama`, `playsound`, and `threading` for sound effects and enhanced user interaction.

## \## ðŸ“Œ How it works:



###### 1\. The program starts by asking the user to \*\*create a new account\*\* with a valid password (with small, capital, number, and special characters)



###### 2\. It \*\*generates a random 11-digit account number\*\*



###### 3\. User logs in using the \*\*generated account number and password\*\*



###### 4\. After login, a \*\*$50 bonus is credited\*\* to the new account



###### 5\. The user can then perform multiple actions:

###### &nbsp;  - `View`: See account number and balance

###### &nbsp;  - `Deposit`: Add money to the account

###### &nbsp;  - `Transfer`: Subtract money from the balance

###### &nbsp;  - `Delete`: Deletes the account (only if balance is $0)

###### &nbsp;  - `Exit`: Quit the session



###### 6\. Sound feedback is played during login, transactions, and account events
