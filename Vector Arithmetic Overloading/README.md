## \# Vector Arithmetic Overloading



###### This is a Python program that demonstrates operator overloading using a custom `Vector` class.

###### It performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two-dimensional vectors.







## \## ðŸ“Œ How it works:





###### 1\. A `Vector` class is defined with two components: `a` and `b`



###### 2\. Operator overloading methods are implemented:

###### Â   - `\\\_\\\_add\\\_\\\_` for vector addition

###### Â   - `\\\_\\\_sub\\\_\\\_` for vector subtraction

###### Â   - `\\\_\\\_mul\\\_\\\_` for element-wise multiplication

###### Â   - `\\\_\\\_truediv\\\_\\\_` for element-wise division



###### 3\. A method `mag()` returns the magnitude of a vector



###### 4\. The `\\\_\\\_repr\\\_\\\_` method formats vector output for readability



###### 5\. Two vector objects are created and all operations are demonstrated



###### 6\. Results, including magnitude, are printed
