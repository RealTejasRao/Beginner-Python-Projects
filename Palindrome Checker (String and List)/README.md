## \# Palindrome Checker (String, List of Strings, List of Integers)





###### This is a basic Python program that checks whether different types of inputs are palindromes.  

###### The program is divided into three parts:



* ###### Checking a string
* ###### Checking a list of strings
* ###### Checking a list of integers





###### <i>Each part runs independently and takes input from the user.</i>





## <i>## ğŸ“Œ How it works:</i>





###### 1\. Part 1: Takes a string as input and checks if it's a palindrome. 



###### 2\. Part 2: Takes a list of strings from the user and checks if the list is a palindrome.



###### 3\. Part 3: Takes a list of integers from the user and checks if the list is a palindrome.  



###### 4\. In each case, the input is reversed and compared with the original.



###### 5\. Prints whether each input is a palindrome or not.
