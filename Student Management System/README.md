## \# Student Management System

###### 

###### A beginner-friendly Python project that allows you to manage student records using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

###### This program runs in the terminal and provides an interactive menu for various student management tasks.





## \## ðŸ“Œ HOW IT WORKS:

###### 

###### \- The program starts with an admin sign-up, requiring a name and a strong password.



###### \- After sign-up, you access a menu to add, delete, search, update, or list students, as well as find the topper and class average.



###### \- All student data is stored in memory (not saved to a file), so it is lost when the program exits.



###### \- Input validation ensures names, ages, and marks are entered correctly.



###### \- Colorful terminal output is provided using the `colorama` library for better user experience.



###### \- Sound feedback is given for errors and successful actions using the `playsound` library.



###### \- After each action, you are returned to the main menu to perform more operations or exit the program.
