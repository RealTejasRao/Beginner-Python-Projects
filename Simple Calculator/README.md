###### \## ðŸ“Œ How it works:



###### 1\. Asks the user to enter the first number  



###### 2\. Asks for an operator (`+`, `-`, `\*`, `/`, `\*\*`, `%`, `//`, `sqrt`) 

###### &nbsp;

###### 3\. If the operator requires two numbers, it asks for the second number 

###### &nbsp;

###### 4\. Performs the operation and prints the result  



###### 5\. Handles invalid inputs and division by zero  



###### 6\. After each calculation, asks if the user wants to perform another one 

###### &nbsp;

###### 7\. Continues or exits based on the userâ€™s response
